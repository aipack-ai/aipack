# Options
```toml
model = "flash"
```

# Description

This assume the `aip run dev@pricing` was ran and create thed `.ai-pricing/pricing-all.json`

Then, we can rust this one as `aip run dev@pricing/genrs`


# Data 

```lua

local p_utils = require("pricing_utils")

local json_content = aip.file.load(p_utils.json_all_path).content

local data_rs = aip.file.load("src/pricing/data.rs")

return {
    json_content = json_content,
    data_rs      = data_rs,
}

```

# Instruction

Below the json file, that we need to translate in a rust file and update the `data.rs` file following its format.

```json
{{data.json_content}}
```

Here is the `data.rs` file to update

```rs
{{data.data_rs.content}}
```

Important, we have to keep the `data.rs` types as is, just update the values. Keep the whitepsaces too. 

Some rules, 
- for openai model, when the name is prefix `openai-` you can remove it from the model name. 
- Ignore "preview" models
- Only change what needs to be changed.

Just give back the `data.rs` file content in a rust makdown code block. 

# Output 


```lua 
local content = ai_response.content
content = aip.md.outer_block_content_or_raw(content)

aip.file.save("src/pricing/data.rs", content)

return "Data saved to src/pricing/data.rs"

```
