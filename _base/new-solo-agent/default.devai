NOTE 1: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

NOTE 2: Solo agents are located in the base directory (not under .devai/) and are intended to generate their sibling files with the same name but without the .devai extension.
    - For example, `./src/main.rs.devai` will generate an output and save it as `./src/main.rs`.
