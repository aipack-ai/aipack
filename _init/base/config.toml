# This `~/.aipack-base/config.toml` file is the base config for all of the aipack workspaces (`.aipack/` container folders)

# Note: Was `default_options` in `<= 0.7.9` (both still supported, but now use 'options')

# `model` required to be able to run an agent. 
#         This will be the fallback for any workspace that does not define its model in their config.toml
#         (any model supported by the Rust genai crate)
#
# Support models from: OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama (local), DeepSeek, Groq, Grok(xAI)
#
# e.g.,  
#    Ollama: "phi4:14b", "gemma3:4b", "gemma3:27b", "deepseek-r1:70b", "llama4:scout" (or any locally installed Ollama)
# Anthropic: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "claude-3-5-haiku-latest"
#    OpenAI: "gpt-4.1, "gpt-4.1-mini", "gpt-4.1-nano", "o4-mini", "o4-mini-high", "o4-mini-low"
#    Gemini: "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06", "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17", "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17-zero"

# Model Aliases
# Define your own model aliases for any model/provider you have access to, and they can be used in place of the model name.
# This can also be overridden or complemented in the `# Options` section of the aipack, or in the `options` return of before all or data
#
# Note: It is important to have `model_aliases` as a property of `default_options.model_aliases` as shown below.
#
# Change as you see fit. Can be overridden in workspace config.toml `.aipack/config.toml`.
